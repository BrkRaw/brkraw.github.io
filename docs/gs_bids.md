# BIDS converter
![brkraw bids](../imgs/brkraw_bids.png)
**The usage of the command-line tool 'brkraw' for BIDS data organization.**

- Upgraded feature to reduce the burden on renaming and organizing according to BIDS guideline.
- The fully organized data can be generated by creating and fill out a BIDS datasheet 
(MS Excel format) from the large set of raw Bruker data. Simply put all raw Bruker data (or zipped) into a folder and
run 'brkraw bids_helper' command with *\<input dir\>* and your preferred *\<output filename\>*.
- The JSON syntax template allows building a JSON metadata to meet the BIDS requirement for each converted image. The 
module provides this JSON syntax template according to BIDS v1.2.2 in case of adding the option '-j' on the command.
- The bids_convert command also will generate empty template of `dataset_description.json` and `README` to better fit
with BIDS guideline, please make sure test your data with official 
[BIDS validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/)

- Below command shows how to generate BIDS datasheet with JSON syntax template

```js
$ brkraw bids_helper <input dir> <output filename> -j
```

- Update the datasheet. For example, if you have a “Gradient echo EPI” scan for BOLD purpose, you could fill in datasheet.xlsx 
with "bold" under "modality" column and "resting" under "task" column for the corresponding scan. Save it when finish.

- After updating the datasheet and syntax, the below command will generate a fully organized BIDS dataset 
to *\<output dir\>* with JSON header files for each converted image by parsing the parameters specified on 
*\<JSON syntax template.json\>*.

```js
$ brkraw bids_convert <input dir> <BIDS datasheet.xlsx> -j <JSON syntax template.json> -o <output dir>
```

- To learn more detail about building your own JSON syntax template, please check our example in
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/brkraw/bruker/blob/master/examples/BrkRaw_PythonAPI.ipynb).
